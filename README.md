This project demonstrates how to implement messaging in a .NET 8 application using both MassTransit and RabbitMQ.Client. It includes two different approaches for producing and consuming messages via RabbitMQ:

MassTransit: A powerful, flexible library that simplifies the process of message-based communication in distributed systems by providing a high-level API for message publishing and consumption.

RabbitMQ.Client: A low-level library that directly interacts with RabbitMQ, offering more control and customization for message handling, but requiring more boilerplate code.

The solution is structured to include a Producer API application that sends messages and a Consumer console application that listens for messages. This project provides a practical example of how to integrate RabbitMQ with .NET 8 applications for building robust and scalable microservices or event-driven architectures.

Key features of this project include:

Integration with MassTransit for high-level messaging.
Usage of RabbitMQ.Client for low-level messaging.
In-Memory Database setup using Entity Framework Core for demonstration.
Swagger integration for API documentation and testing.
